        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I started my interest in prgramming at the age of 14 when I wanted to build "the perfect" video
            game.
            <br><br>
            I looked for the biggest book in my local libarary on C++, unaware of the mountain I would need
            to climb. But I was equally surprised by my own persistence, discipline and fortituide, that
            some 15+ years later, I would finally be in a position to <i>begin</i> to do so!
